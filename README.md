# COBOLCalc
A simple unfeatured calculator written in MicroFocus COBOL for Visual Studio 2015

![alt tag](http://ramenscafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CobolCalc.png)

Intended as a primitive demo of COBOL in an WPF app. It accomplishes basic arithmetic. Does not support operation chaining (e.g. 2+2+2+2, but you can operate on results) or order of operations. Feel free to extend and make contributions; the more featured the calculator, the better sample resource developers will be able to refer to.
